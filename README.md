# node-red-contrib-global
[Node-Red](http://nodered.org) Node that sets/gets a context.global variable.

#Install

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install

	npm install node-red-contrib-global

While in development, install with:
   
    npm install https://github.com/TotallyInformation/node-red-contrib-global/tarball/master

#Usage

The node expects an input from the incoming msg. By default, this is msg.payload. If it is a recognisable date/time, it will apply a format and output the resulting string or
object accordingly.

There are 5 parameters to the node.

1. *Topic* - as expected, if provided, msg.topic will be set on the output. Otherwise, any input topic is passed through
2. *Input* - defines the Property on the input msg that carries the date/time. msg.payload by default.
   Input must be either a Javascript Date object or a [date/time string that can be parsed by Modment.JS](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string/).

   It tries to work out the input format and allows more variations to be recognised. Such as 'Thursday, February 6th, 2014 9:20pm'

   It can also be null, non-existant or an empty string, in which case it will be set to the current date/time. Useful for easily injecting the
   current date/time from any trigger.
3. *Format* - defines how the output should be formatted.
   Can be any [format string recognised by Moment.JS](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/) or one of (alternative spellings in brackets, spellings are not case sensitive):
    <dl>
        <dt>If left blank</dt>
        <dd>If the input is a Javascript Date object, output in ISO8601 format. If the input is a recognised date string, output a Javascript Date object</dd>
        <dt>ISO8601 (ISO)</dt>
        <dd>ISO 8602 format, e.g. "2015-01-28T16:24:48+00:00"<br>This is the default if the input is a Javascript Date object</dd>
        <dt>date (jsDate)</dt>
        <dd>a Javascript Date object<br>This is the default if the input is a recognised date string</dd>
        <dt>fromNow (timeAgo)</dt>
        <dd>e.g. 30 minutes ago</dd>
        <dt>calendar (aroundNow)</dt>
        <dd>e.g. "Last Monday", "Tomorrow 2:30pm"</dd>
    </dl>
4. *Output* - defines the property on the output msg that will carry the formatted date/time string (or Javascript object).
5. *Name* - as usual, a unique name identifier for the node instance.

#To Do

Summary of things I'd like to do with the moment node (not necessarily immediately):

* [ ] Add a combo box to the Format field with common formats pre-populated
  Combo boxes are fiddly in HTML. 
* [ ] Improve the error messages when Moment.JS fails to interpret the input (say why)
* [ ] Allow more input date/time formats - turns out Moment.JS doesn't really help here. At present, I see too many input failures from US/UK date formats, etc.
  It would be great if I could parse "human" inputs like "tomorrow" and "2 minutes from now". We can output them now but not input them.

  ~~Partly complete: Added the [parseFormat plugin](https://github.com/gr2m/moment.parseFormat).~~ That failed, see code for details.

  Maybe add a dropdown with a country code to give a hint.
